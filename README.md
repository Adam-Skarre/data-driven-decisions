# Data-Driven Decisions: Monte Carlo Analysis for Technical Communications

This course is designed to build expertise in two key areas:
- Monte Carlo 
- Technical Writing

Engineering practice takes many forms, but at its core engineers are
defined by how they _innovate using quantifiable methods_. 

Monte Carlo is a skillset that uses random numbers to create
computational experiments. Monte Carlo experiments can quantify and predict a
number of outcomes e.g. deterministic parameters such as areas and
columes, probability of failure, propagation of error. 

Technical writing is a crucial skill to communicate innovations,
predictions, and results. Technical communication is the delivery of
technical information to readers in a manner that is adapted to their
needs, level of understanding, and background.  The ability to
"translate" technical information to nonspecialists is a key skill to
any technical communicator.
