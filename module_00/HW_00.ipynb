This is the benchmark to determine if the AI or I contibuted more to the document. The revised document is considerably different. In each step, I added my own background and experience to enhance the instructions to make it clear and concise. Additionally, I added an extra step to use mouthwash to enhance tooth health if deemed necessary. Therefore, 6 ideas were added by me. The document is heavily edited so it is a new document. I would credit another person as a coauthor. A general idea was provided and built upon. This person would deserve a coauthor credit. The AI document and revised document differed greatly. This process proved as an example of how an AI written document differs to a document written by an engineer."
