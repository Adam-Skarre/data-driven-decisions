- **ME3255 - Discussions**: [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/cooperrc/data-driven-decisions/discussions)

**Course Description**: This course explores the integration of Monte Carlo
analysis—a powerful probabilistic modeling technique—with technical
communication. Students will learn how to effectively communicate results from
Monte Carlo methods for both technical and non-technical audiences. Topics
covered include probability modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, statistical
analysis, and the creation of technical reports and presentations.

## Course Objectives:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Create Visualizations of Data:**
    - Generate effective and informative visual representations of engineering data using appropriate tools (e.g., Excel, Python, or MATLAB)
    - Select the suitable visualizations e.g. plots, bar charts, scatter
     plots, histograms, contour for different data sets and
     communication purposes

2. **Explain the Importance of Graphs and Visualizations in a Technical Document:**
    - Explain the significance of graphs and visualizations to describe technical information
    - Use graphics to enhance the clarity and impact of technical documents

3. **Edit and Improve Work to Maintain Active Voice and Concise Writing:**
    - Identify and revise passive voice constructions in technical writing 
    - Improve technical documents for conciseness by eliminating unnecessary words and redundancies
    - Proof read work to identify and improve technical communications
    - Peer review and provide constructive feedback

2. **Analyze Technical Audiences for Engineering Communication:**
    - Identify and analyze the needs and expectations of different technical audiences 
    - Edit technical writing to communicate with technical audiences
   
4. **Probability Modeling:**
    - Explain the principles and applications of Monte Carlo simulation in data-driven decision-making
    - Develop probabilistic models for real-world scenarios
    - Apply probability concepts to quantify uncertainty
  
5. **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
    - Create Monte Carlo simulations using software tools (e.g., Python, R) to analyze complex systems and scenarios
    - Interpret and communicate the results of Monte Carlo simulations
6. **Statistical Analysis:**
    - Perform statistical analysis of simulation data to extract meaningful insights
    - Present statistical findings clearly and concisely

## Course Information
__Course Title:__ ME3256 - Data Driven Decisions: Monte Carlo Analysis for Technical Communications

__Format:__ Online

__Instructor__: Prof. Ryan C. Cooper __<ryan.c.cooper@uconn.edu>__

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of probability and statistics is
recommended. Familiarity with programming languages such as Python or R is
beneficial but not required. Example code and resources will be distributed and
discussed.

__Office Hours/Availability:__ by appointment

__Preferred Contact:__ Post questions and comments to
[Discussions](https://github.com/cooperrc/data-driven-decisions/discussions)

## Assessment Methods:
1. **Written Assignments:** Prepare three 500-word technical documents with one visualization each
2. **Technical Report:** Present a Monte Carlo solution to an engineering problem in a 3000-word technical report
4. **Peer Review and Feedback:** Evaluate peers' technical communication, specifically revisions on the main technical report project
5. **Online Discussions:** Actively participate in online discussions and revisions

## Grading Policy:
- Written Assignments: 30%
- Technical Report: 30%
- Online Discussions and Participation: 20%
- Peer Review: 20%

**Note on Written assignments:** Each written assignment will ask you to
explain a technical result to a given audience. You will get comments on the
assignment and a current grade. You can increase your grade by addressing the
comments and resubmitting the work.

**Note on Technical Report:** The project is a longer technical document for other
entry-level engineers. You will be asked to outline the report and share your
proposed figures and images that will help communicate your findings throughout
the course. You should plan to give and receive feedback on each stage of the writing process: 
- outline
- first draft
- final draft

## Academic Integrity: 
- The instructors of this class have a zero-tolerance policy for academic misconduct, that
  is copying others' work either in the lab, field, or on an exam.  Any student work that
  is found to be in violation of the university policy regarding academic misconduct
   will be assigned a grade of zero at a
  minimum.
- Read and understand [The UConn Student Code of
  Conduct](http://www.community.uconn.edu/student_code.html "The Student Code for Academic
  Integrity"). Students will follow all University regulations concerning the final exam.

## Due Dates and Late Policy

All course due dates are identified in the course calendar.
Deadlines are based on Eastern Time; if you are in a different time zone, please
adjust your submittal times accordingly. The instructor reserves the right to
change dates accordingly as the course progresses.  _All changes will be
communicated via the calendar or another appropriate notification._

__Late Policy__: You must submit
_something_ for every due date. You can resubmit any assignment to get
points back, but if you miss the submission date, its a 0. If you are
